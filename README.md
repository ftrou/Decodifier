# Decodifier  
### **The Compiler for AI-Generated Software**

**LLMs don’t write code.**  
They write **intent**.  
Decodifier compiles that intent into working software.

---

## 🚀 What is Decodifier?

Decodifier is a new layer in the AI stack:

> **A compiler for LLM-generated software.  
> LLMs write specs. Decodifier builds the code.**

Instead of prompting models to generate Python, TypeScript, or SQL directly, LLMs (or humans) produce **small declarative specs**. Decodifier validates them, compiles them, and updates the codebase — **without the model ever reading or editing files.**

This creates a **token firewall** between LLMs and codebases:

- LLMs stay at the **architecture & intent** level  
- Decodifier handles the **code**  
- Projects stay consistent, safe, and scalable

---

## 🧩 Why this matters

AI coding today is stuck in a chat window:  
LLMs regenerate files, hallucinate imports, and break architecture.

With Decodifier:

| Without Decodifier | With Decodifier |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| “Write a FastAPI endpoint for users” | ```yaml<br>kind: backend.http_endpoint<br>name: create_user<br>path: "/api/users"<br>method: post``` |
| 200–800 tokens of code | **8 lines of intent** |
| LLM must read repo | **No repo access needed** |
| Architecture drifts | Architecture is enforced |
| Code is the medium | **Specs are the medium** |

**Result:**  

LLMs develop features without touching code.
## 🧮 Token Efficiency Example

Traditional LLM coding:
• 4,000–20,000 tokens / request
• Repeated context reload
• Frequent hallucinations

With Decodifier specs:
• 50–300 tokens / request
• No file diffing or context reload
• Zero hallucinated imports

## 🏗️ What it looks like

**input →**

```yaml
# patterns/specs/backend.user.create.yaml
kind: backend.http_endpoint
name: create_user
path: "/api/users"
method: post
request_model: UserCreate
response_model: User

command →

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/patterns/build" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"spec_dir": "patterns/specs", "project_root": "."}'

output →

backend/api/generated_endpoints.py  ✓
backend/request_schemas.py          ✓
backend/response_schemas.py         ✓
```

LLM never saw or generated these files.
🎛️ Core Concepts
1. Patterns

Reusable architecture definitions.

Examples:

    backend.model

    backend.http_endpoint

    backend.crud

    backend.request_schema

    backend.storage

    agent.llm_chat

    service.queue_worker

2. Specs

Tiny YAML files produced by humans or LLMs.
3. Compiler

Validates → normalizes → generates → wires code.
4. Token Firewall

LLMs do not read or modify source files.
They operate entirely through specs + build results.
📉 Why this saves tokens

LLMs don’t waste compute on:

  -  repo embeddings

  -  code diffs

  -  file rewrites

  -  correcting hallucinated imports

Instead of generating code, they generate intent.

This reduces token usage by 60–90% in AI-assisted development.
📈 Why this matters at scale

If adopted inside a large organization:

  -  Fewer GPUs needed for development workflows

  -  Models don’t need huge context windows for legacy repos

  -  Smaller models can do more work

  -  Architecture becomes enforceable, not optional

  -  At hyperscaler scale, this could represent
    $100M–$500M/year in net efficiency
    (compute + engineering time), even with partial rollout.

📌 Status
Version	Stage	What it does
v0.1	PROTOTYPE	LLM-safe file read/write + project ops
v0.2	CURRENT	Pattern engine, validator, FastAPI backend generation
v0.3	In Progress	No-Code-for-LLMs: full backend extension without reading code
v1.0	ROADMAP	Pattern packs, DB/CRUD, agents, auth, diff-safe generation
🎯 v0.3 Mission

  -  A full backend can be extended without the LLM ever reading the generated code.

Milestones:

  -  backend.model generator

  -  backend.crud integration

  -  request/response schema emitters

  -  router auto-mount

  -  test harness generation

This will complete the first end-to-end pattern chain.

Add a spec → click Generate from Specs → watch the backend evolve.
📣 Join the Category

  -  Decodifier is the first compiler for AI-generated software.
  -  LLMs don’t need to write code. They need a compiler that does.

If you’re building AI systems and want to collaborate, open an issue or reach out.

This isn’t a tool.
This is a new layer.
🧠 Vision

Software creation becomes:

Architecture → Patterns → Specs → Compiler → Code → Running System

LLMs operate at the architecture tier.
Decodifier handles the rest.

This is how AI development scales.

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
pip install decodifier
decodifier init myproject
decodifier generate
